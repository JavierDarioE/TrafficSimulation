# TrafficSimulation
A small app made in Scala to simulate the traffic in the city of Medellín, made for the course "logic and funtional programming" of the National University of Colombia - Medellín.

Note: The app data will be saved once you close the simulation window.

* To launch the program you'll need to put the roads and intersections info into neo4j first, you can view the commands in this [link](https://pastebin.com/UELQ0d0w), or in the root folder as a file called "MallaVial Neo4j.txt".


## Tools used

* [JFreechart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) A library to graph charts.
* [Graph for Scala](http://www.scala-graph.org/) Another library to graph points and lines.
* [Lift-Json](https://github.com/lift/lift/tree/master/framework/lift-base/lift-json) A library to handle .json files.
* For Lift-Json to work properly you'll need [Paranamer-2.2.1](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/p/Downloadparanamer221jar.htm).
* [Neo4j Driver](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.neo4j.driver/neo4j-java-driver/1.7.2) For the conection from scala to neo4j.
